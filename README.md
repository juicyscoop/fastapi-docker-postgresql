This is a demo React Application, comprising:

1. Backend -> FastAPI with Postgresql
2. Frontend -> react-app

First Demo
######
	- numerical data taken from YahooAPI - AAPL Stock
	- this data visualized with a LineGrah - close price on daily granularity
	- storage/update within database after each render?
	- DatePicker -> user can input time range to be used for visualization
	- Confirm button -> apply seletion in DatePicker
nice to have:
- API is able to handle at least 100 requests/s
- LineGraph rendering is smooth and quick
